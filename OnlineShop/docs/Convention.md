## Conventions

### When you use the "if" statement in your code, always enclose the condition within curly braces "{}".
+ Correct
```
if (condition)
{
    // Execute the action when the condition is true
}

```
+ Incorrect
``` 
if (condition)
    // Action is only executed when the condition is true
```
